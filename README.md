# DenseNet-on-CIFAR-dataset

A DenseNet is a type of convolutional neural network that utilises dense connections between layers, through Dense Blocks, where we connect all layers (with matching feature-map sizes) directly with each other.

The dataset is popular CIFAR dataset.

Trained DenseNet with three different models using data augmentation, raw architecture
